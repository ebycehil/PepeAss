    <h2>⚠️ The AssPepe Manifesto: War Against Scam Coins</h2>
    <p>
        We are sick of the endless rug pulls, fake promises, and scam coins flooding the crypto world. 
        AssPepe is a revolution, a movement against the **fraudsters, pump-and-dump schemers, and fake influencers** who 
        manipulate innocent investors for their own profit.
    </p>
    <p>
        No more **Ponzi schemes**, no more **fake liquidity**, no more **developers running away with millions**. 
        The era of scammers is over. AssPepe is here to burn them all down and bring **real meme power** back to the people.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you’re tired of getting scammed, if you’re done with **empty promises and worthless whitepapers**, 
        then welcome to AssPepe. This is not just another meme coin. **This is war.**
    </p>
